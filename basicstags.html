            10 essential HTML tags
        </h1>

        <h4>Before we look at the 10 basic HTML codes, you should know that the first line of your HTML document must always contain the <!DOCTYPE html> tag. This will make your site's code readable in any browser.<br>
            <br>A well-built HTML document has 10 essential tags for the content to render correctly. These are:
        </h4>

        <h1>
            1. HTML
        </h1>
                First on our list of basic HTML codes is html >. It is placed at the beginning of an HTML document and tells browsers that the page has HTML code so they can read it that way. Following the syntax of the language, the closing tag </html> will be the last element of the document.
                <h1>
                    2. Header
                </h1>
                Next,  head > is the tag used for the header of the page. Its main function is to contain all the information on the operation of the site. Because of this, it is an encrypted code that people who visit the web page cannot see.
                <h1>
                    3. Page title
                </h1> 
                 title > is the tag that gives your site a name so users can identify it. This is the title that they will see in their browser tabs.
                <h1>
                    4. Body

                </h1>  body > is the tag that contains all the individual elements of the site. This tag includes all the visible content of the site. <BR>
                    Here you can insert:<BR>
                        <ul>
                            <LI>Text</LI>
                            <li>Photo or Images</li>
                            <li>Video</li>
                            <li>Any other functionality you want to display</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>An example of how the code would look:</p>

<p>With these four basic HTML tags, you already have the “skeleton” of your web page.<br><br>
    The next task would be to enter content (between the  body > and  /body > tags) and control your tags.<br><br>
    Now let's look at the most popular types of content.
</p>
<h1>
    5. Titles and subtitles
</h1>
  h1 >,  h2 > and  h6 > are tags that format titles and subheadings within the text, which help to prioritize the information for the reader. <br>
 We recommend that you use the H1 tag only once within the content for each web page.<br><br>
 Example:<br>
 <ul>
    <li> h1 >This is an H1 tag. Use it in the title. /h1 ></h1>
        <li> h2 >This is an H2 tag. Use it in section headers. /h2 ></li>
        <li> h3 >This is an H3 tag. Use it in sub-sections. /h3 ></li>
        <li> h4 >This is an H4 tag. They are not used very often. /h4 ></li>
        <li> h5 >This is an H5 tag. /h5 ></li>
        <li> h6 >This is an H6 tag. /h6 ></li>
 </ul><br>
 <br>
 <h4>Results</h4>

<h1>6. Paragraphs
</h1>
The  p > and  br > tags will help you organize your text into paragraphs and line breaks. <br>
<br> Example:
<ul>
    <li> p >Your first paragraph. /p ></li>
    <li> p >Your second paragraph. /p ></li>
    <li> p >A sentence. br ></li> <br>
    A second sentence (pasted to the first). /p >
</ul>
 <pr>Results:</pr><br>

<h1>7. Images
</h1> With the  img > tag, you can add photos and graphic images to the body of your web page.

Combining it with the src attribute will allow you to specify the location where the image is located, and the alt attribute will help you give that image a title for search engines like Google to read.<br>
<br>
The structure of the attributes is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>First comes the <b>word or abbreviation</b> that defines it (in this case src is an abbreviation of source)</li>
    <li>Then the equal sign (=)</li>
    <li>Lastly the modifier of the attribute in double quotes. (“_”) or simple ('_')</li>
</ul> 
Example: <br>

<p>Results:</p>

<h1>8. Hyperlinks
</h1>The  a > tag allows you to insert a clickable hyperlink to your page. For example, the link to your social networks or to another website with which you want to connect your page.<br>
<br>Example:<br>
 a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">Visit previous Page /a ><br>
<br>
<h3><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">Visit previous Page</a> <br><br>As you may have noticed, the attribute used here was href.</h3>

<h1>9. Lists and indexes
</h1>  ol > is used to add numbered lists and  ul > is used to add bullets, which improve the readability of your text.

    <br>Elements like these break up long passages of text into bite-sized portions that are easy for people to consume.<br>
    <br>Example:<br>
<img src="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/uk/wp-content/uploads/html-code-for-a-bulleted-list-min.png"><br>
<br>Results<br>
<img src="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/uk/wp-content/uploads/output-for-list-html-min.png">
<h1>10.
</h1> 

Although usually located inside the  head > tag, with the  style > attribute, you can define the style of your content in terms of:
<ul>
    <li>Colour</li>
    <li>Font size</li>
    <li>Typography etc.</li>
</ul><br>
Example:
 p style="color:red; font-size:100px" >Hello World  /p >
<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
